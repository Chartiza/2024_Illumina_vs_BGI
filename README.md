### PROJECT: 2023_Illumina_vs_BGI
(collaboration project between Kateryna Pantiukh & Elin Org and Tomasz Kościółek & Kinga Zielińska & Łukasz Szydłowski)

### Motivation

The purpose of this project is to assess the quality of sequencing reads generated by different NGS platforms for the same set of samples. By comparing the FastQC results, Kraken results, we can gain insights into the performance and potential variations between these platforms.

### The folders represent the different analysis steps.
- Step1. Reads quality comparison. FASTQ
- Step2. Reads annotation comparison. KRAKEN
  - Solve the mystery of the Ugly sample
